		<p>Did you hear about deep learning and Google's AlphaGo?
		First what is Deep Learning? It is a model of artificial intelligence designed to continually analyze
		data with a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusion.</p>
		<p>In order to achieve this, deep learning applications needs to use a structure of algorithms called
		<strong>artificial neural network</strong> This network is inspired by our human brain, leading to 
		a process of learning which is better than a machine learning model</p>
		<p>Machine learning is another model, to make it simple, it analyzes data and draw conclusions.
		For example spotify and netflix uses a machine learning model to tell you what you would love to watch or listen to next.
		With that model an engineer has to do some adjustments when the predictions are inaccurate. 
		The Deep Learning model can determine on his own if a prediction is inaccurate</p>
		<p>A great example of Deep Learning is Google's AlphaGo which is a board game similar but way more complicated than chest.
		The bord is divided on 19 horizontal squares and 19 vertical squares. Needless to say the statistics of
		the opponent moves are pretty hard to process.
		This computer program was created with a neural network that learned how to play Go against professional players.</p>
		<p>Without any human help the program learned (and played moves never seen before) 
		and even defeated the multiple world master of the game.</p>
