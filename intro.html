		<p>My name is Alexis Petre and I'm 28 years old.</p>
		<p>I like a lot of different things in life that's why I couldn't decide what studies I wanted to do.
		My first idea as a child was veterinary ('cause you know, cat's are so kawaiii/actually I must admit I'm more of a dog person #donthitmeplease), 
		so that's what I did for 2 years at ULB but I only studied and passed the courses that I was interested in.</p>
		<p>Then after a break, I realized that I've always liked IT as well so I've enrolled to a night school and I might get my degree next year.</p>
		<p>Speaking of nights: in 2013 I found my first job as administrative assistant for the emergency department of Brugmann. 
		Yes it is the building next to ours so I'm not really troubled by the location change(which is about 50 meters, wait, now that I think of that, mayble I 
		will be troubled and maybe I'll find myself at my old desk wondering where I am?).</p> 
		<p>I've been working nights there for 6 years from 8pm to 7am... Yeah, living during the nights, avoiding the Sun, 
		also having romanian blood in my veins... But I swear I'm not a vampire(or am I?)!</p>
